# PROTOTYPE-FOR-REAL-TIME-STRESS-DETECTION-USING-MULTIMODAL-SIGNALS
Stress detection using physiological signals has become a key area of research due to its potential impact on health and well-being .This paper presents a prototype for real-time stress level detection using multimodal signals and transfer learning techniques. The model utilizes data from physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA or GSR), Accelerometer, and temperature to capture the physiological changes that occur during stress . Data was collected from 10 participants, and feature extraction was performed to capture relevant information from each signal. The system utilizes a binary classification model to predict whether an individual is experiencing “stress” or not based on the extracted features. Dual-model approach leverages multimodal data to improve stress detection accuracy, with GSR data providing a reliable initial label and ECG data enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different physiological signals to improve model generalization with limited sample data. Initial results indicate promising accuracy, highlighting the potential of multimodal physiological data for real-time stress monitoring applications.
